# GA_Software_Design
Project for the course "Software Design" at Games Academy

This game is a clone of the game Rogue. The implementation has intentionally bad design choices in names, documentation and violates the SOLID principles. Can you figure out which parts of the code violate what principles? How can you improve the code?
